# Tensorflow-EchoStateNetwork
Echo state network implementation on TensorFlow. The reservoir is provided as an `RNNCell`.
## How to
- See [`example.ipynb`](example.ipynb) for an example on how to use the library.
- Read the docs in [`esn_cell.py`](esn_cell.py) for more in depth details.
- See [PracticalESN](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/11bb/0941b1f6088783e26d7f9603789ee1db7faa.pdf) for some good advice on how to use Echo State Networks successfully.
